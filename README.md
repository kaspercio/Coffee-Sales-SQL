A project to gather business insights for coffee shops based on data gathered in New York over the first six months of 2023.

## Dataset

## Query 1

### What is the trend for Coffee Sales Revenue?

### SQL Query
We find the total revenue by month using (quantity Ã— unit price).

```sql
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', transaction_date) AS month,
    ROUND(SUM(transaction_qty * unit_price), 2) AS total_sales
FROM coffee_sales
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', transaction_date)
ORDER BY month;
```
### Output
```
         month          | total_sales 
------------------------+-------------
 2023-01-01 00:00:00+00 |    81677.74
 2023-02-01 00:00:00+00 |    76145.19
 2023-03-01 00:00:00+00 |    98834.68
